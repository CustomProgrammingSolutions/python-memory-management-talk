# First some assumptions

We are going to assume that RAM is addressable in a sequential manner.

We are also going to assume that a given address is a unique location that we can store information at.
Or alternatively that any 2 distinct addresses are distinct locations in memory.

---

# What is a variable?

* Symbolic name
* Storage location

???

If more than one symbolic name is located at the same storage location this is referred to as [aliasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing_(computing)). 

---

# Variables

```python
>>> foo = [1,2,3]
>>> id(foo)
140249342557576
```

* `foo` is the symbolic name
* `id(foo)` is where foo is stored at
* `[1,2,3]` is what we find there

# Pythontutor

There's a great site for getting intuition into how variables work in Python: http://pythontutor.com/

Let's have a look at this example:

```python
a = 1
b = "abc"
c = [a, b]
```

# How does Python store variables in memory

Exactly how this works is an Python implementation dependent detail, we will look at how CPython does it.

Just about everything is stored in variables in the same way, different types, functions, etc.
(This will concept will come up throughout this)

---

# Python and objects

Python is an "Object Oriented Language", which in this case means that almost every variable is accessible via a similar interface.
Python has the notion of a [data model](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html), where objects are the abstraction Python uses for data.

And as many things as possible are stored in these objects as possible across the language.

These are `PyObjects` in the source and if you look around the source code you'll see these `PyObjects` all over the place. All these `PyObjects` are allocated in a chunk of memory that people may informally refer to as "the heap".

???
Other language don't attempt to have everything behind the same interface, for example c++ handles functions very differently to variables in the sense that you can't easily assign a function to a variable using the same semantics that another simple assignment would take. Another annoying difference is how arrays have different semantics to say integers. In Python you'll notice that almost every variable can be manipulated via a similar interface, this is a powerful part of the Python paradigm.

---

# CPython Objects - where everything goes

When you start the CPython interpreter you are invoking [/Modules/main.c](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Modules/main.c).
This sets up the variables and memory that the interpreter needs to run your code. It generates this memory layout:

![CPython Memory layout diagram](CPythonMemoryLayout.png)


???

[/Modules/main.c](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Modules/main.c) does a lot from handling the command line options (such as `'-c'` and `'-m'` etc) to initializing the various bits of state required to actually run the interpreter.

---

# CPython Objects - builtin objects

![Builtin objects](BuiltinObjects.png)

---

# CPython Objects - builtin objects

You will have noticed that there's a fixed sized area set aside for builtin objects.

Values such as `True`, `False` and `None` are stored here. They are all stored as singletons.

This means that any identity comparison will always be true for these particular objects.

For example any variable that has the value of `None` will always point to the same address. They will have the same id as there is only the one `None` object which lives in that special area of memory.

The objects that get special treatment are all found in the source at [/Objects](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/master/Objects)

---

# CPython Objects - where non-builtin variables are stored

![Object storage](PyObjectStorage.png)

---

# CPython Objects - where non-builtin variables are stored

[Since Python 2.3](https://docs.python.org/2.3/whatsnew/section-pymalloc.html) CPython has used some functions very similar to the C `malloc` and `free` functions to allocate the memory in which objects are stored. These functions are modified to be more suitable for allocating the Python objects we commonly see.

What malloc does is *alloc*ates a space in *m*emory for which a variable can be placed and gives you the pointer to where that space starts.

In CPython when you do `id(something)` what you are seeing is the memory address of where `something` resides:

```python
>>> foo = 123
>>> id(foo)
10923328
```

`foo` is at located at the memory address `10923328`

???
Most of the time when you store different items they will end up at different addresses, but not always.

Some items commonly used items are optimized to just be in one place and will therefore have a reference to that place.

For example:
```python
>>> c = None
>>> id(c)
10748000
>>> d = None
>>> id(d)
10748000
```

`None` is always stored at the same address

Small integers are cached

```python
>>> e = 5
>>> id(e)
10919552
>>> f = 5
>>> id(f)
10919552

```

"Large" integers however are not:

```python
>>> a = 12345
>>> id(a)
140498856595248
>>> b = 12345
>>> id(b)
140498834051248
```

Note how the small integers and values like `None` are in a completely different area of memory to the non-cached variables.

---

# CPython objects - what

So we know where the objects end up in memory but what exactly gets put there?

The source code for objects is defined at [/Include/object.h](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Include/object.h)

A comment from the source:

    Objects are structures allocated on the heap.  Special rules apply to
    the use of objects to ensure they are properly garbage-collected.
    Objects are never allocated statically or on the stack; they must be
    accessed through special macros and functions only.

    An object has a 'reference count' that is increased or decreased when a
    pointer to the object is copied or deleted; when the reference count
    reaches zero there are no references to the object left and it can be
    removed from the heap.

---

# Where variables are stored

![Object storage](PyObjectStorage.png)

Variables are stored in the stack frames but what the refer to are stored in the Object storage space we talked about before.

---

# How variables are implemented

https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/b2984ab9a7c458f8b7ed8978c0c95b109116895d/Include/object.h#L101:
```c
/* Nothing is actually declared to be a PyObject, but every pointer to
 * a Python object can be cast to a PyObject*.  This is inheritance built
 * by hand.  Similarly every pointer to a variable-size Python object can,
 * in addition, be cast to PyVarObject*.
 */
typedef struct _object {
    _PyObject_HEAD_EXTRA
    Py_ssize_t ob_refcnt;
    struct _typeobject *ob_type;
} PyObject;
```

This gives us the base from which everything else is built.
This is a placeholder into which we can store arbitrary variables.

???

This provides for the reference counted memory management of anything stored within it.

`_PyObject_HEAD_EXTRA` os a preprocessor macro that deals with a debug tracing feature and is often #defined away as nothing.

---

# The type of an object

The type of an object defines what you can find in them, in the source code this is found here in [Doc/includes/typestruct.h](
https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/b2984ab9a7c458f8b7ed8978c0c95b109116895d/Doc/includes/typestruct.h).

This is necessary for 2 reasons, it is required so that Python knows how much space to set aside for the variable in the RAM.
It also allows Python to know what interface is supported by that variable.

---

# Types part 2

Now instead of storing the types everywhere as you can see in the C source code there's a pointer. Each variable has this reference to some memory which defines what type it is.

What resides at the address is found with the `type` builtin:
```python
>>> a = 123
>>> type(a)
<class 'int'>
```

---

# Types

Everything in Python must have information about the type, otherwise Python wouldn't know how to handle these entities. This is why it is in the `PyObject` C structure that is the base for *all* Python variables.

You can find the type of any item in Python using `type`:

```python
>>> type(1)
<class 'int'>
>>> type("abc")
<class 'str'>
>>> type([1,2,3])
<class 'list'>
```

---

# Python objects, what's in them?

Because everything has this similar interface to access we have some nice tools like `dir` to see what's inside an object:

```python
>>> a = [1,2,3]
>>> dir(a)
['__add__', '__class__', '__contains__', '__delattr__', '__delitem__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__getitem__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__iadd__', '__imul__', '__init__', '__iter__', '__le__', '__len__', '__lt__', '__mul__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__reversed__', '__rmul__', '__setattr__', '__setitem__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', 'append', 'clear', 'copy', 'count', 'extend', 'index', 'insert', 'pop', 'remove', 'reverse', 'sort']
```

This tells us which methods we can call on `a`. All the double underscore or "dunder" methods as they are known have special meaning in terms of the interface they provide.

`__len__` lets us find the length of the item via the `len` function.
```python
>>> len(a)
3
```

???

`dir` is defined in the C source here https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/b2984ab9a7c458f8b7ed8978c0c95b109116895d/Objects/object.c#L1479-L1487

`len(a)` just calls `a.__len__`.

---

# Functions have this interface too

Functions are also accessible via this same object interface:

```python
>>> def foo():
...     print("bar")
... 
>>> dir(foo)
['__annotations__', '__call__', '__class__', '__closure__', '__code__', '__defaults__', '__delattr__', '__dict__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__get__', '__getattribute__', '__globals__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__kwdefaults__', '__le__', '__lt__', '__module__', '__name__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__qualname__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__']
```

This means we can pass functions around just as easily as variables.
`__call__` is part of the function interface, something not in the list interface.

More about functions a little later...

# How variables end up layed out in heap memory

This is in the source at [Include/object.h](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/b2984ab9a7c458f8b7ed8978c0c95b109116895d/Include/object.h#L460-L477)
```c
/* The *real* layout of a type object when allocated on the heap */
typedef struct _heaptypeobject {
    /* Note: there's a dependency on the order of these members
       in slotptr() in typeobject.c . */
    PyTypeObject ht_type;
    PyAsyncMethods as_async;
    PyNumberMethods as_number;
    PyMappingMethods as_mapping;
    PySequenceMethods as_sequence;
    PyBufferProcs as_buffer;
    PyObject *ht_name, *ht_slots, *ht_qualname;
    struct _dictkeysobject *ht_cached_keys;
    /* here are optional user slots, followed by the members. */
} PyHeapTypeObject;
```
Note the memory is layed out in exactly that order.

---

# How many variables do we need to assign?

In the previous example we saw that we needed to assign 3 variables.

But what about this:

```python
a = 1
b = 2

def foo():
    bar = 1
    baz = 2
foo()
```

Understanding this requires to know how a stack frame works.

???

The total number of variables that have to be assigned is completely dependent on how many times `foo` is called


---

# Stack frames

Stack frames contain all the information required to allow function calls to work.

Functions are themselves variables but they have a few extra things going on too. Specifically they need to be able to set aside some memory for storing the references to the other variables stored in them.

When we create a function we have to put aside the memory for all the variables inside it as well as the function call machinery.
This is most easily achieved with a stack based structure and therefore is how CPython has implemented it. These entities are called frame objects.

???

A stack is not the only way to do this, projects such as stackless python have experimented with other approaches.


---

# Example from before

```python
a = 1
b = 2

def foo():
    bar = 1
    baz = 2
foo()

# Local variables to a frame

Mostly we never have to concern ourselves with the direct memory layout in Python (phew), we have much easier ways to work with these objects.

In the `PyFrameObject` we see that there's an item called `Pyobject *f_locals`
This stores the local variables to that frame. Let's see how this works with the following:

```python
def foo():
    bar = "abc"
    baz = 123
```

---

# Local variables to a frame - implementation

```python
>>> import dis
>>> dis.show_code(foo)
Name:              foo
Filename:          <stdin>
Argument count:    0
Kw-only arguments: 0
Number of locals:  2
Stack size:        1
Flags:             OPTIMIZED, NEWLOCALS, NOFREE
Constants:
   0: None
   1: 'abc'
   2: 123
Variable names:
   0: bar
   1: baz
```

The `dis` module provides a handy human readable output of what's going on.

Garbage collection: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)

---

# How CPython does garbage collection

Python is a managed language, you don't have to manually manage memory as you would in say C++ or Rust.

When you create a variable Python will set aside the memory needed to store that variable.
When variables are not needed anymore Python has to reclaim the memory.

How this works is implementation specific CPython has a simple reference count based approach, chosen primarily for maximum compatibility.
(Jython uses the JVM memory management, PyPy has a different strategy)

---

# Python's reference counter

Remember from earlier that every python variable has a reference count associated with it (`Py_ssize_t ob_refcnt;`)

Each time you make reference to a variable the reference count for the variable is incremented, when that count gets to zero then you have nothing referring to that variable anymore* at which point the item's `__del__` method gets called and the memory can be reused.

*There _are_ ways around this if you need them, see [weakref](https://docs.python.org/3/library/weakref.html) for example.

???

This is good reading for how this all works: https://docs.python.org/3/extending/extending.html#reference-counts

If you make C extensions you have to manually increment and decrement references.

---

# What about cycles?

Unfortunately a purely reference counting based implementation can't break cycles.

This is why there's a cycle detector in CPython that periodically runs:

https://docs.python.org/3/library/gc.html

???

There's an edge case in older versions of Python where the cycle detector can't actually free the memory, this is when objects define `__del__` in such a way that the interpreter cannot safely pick which to run first since `__del__` can contain arbitraty code. When this happens the objects get placed in [`gc.garbage`](http://docs.python.org/library/gc.html#gc.garbage) to be dealt with by the programmer. Or just forgotten entirely... This is where things like https://pythonhosted.org/Pympler/ are useful to detect leaked memory.

Since PEP 442 https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0442/ which got included in Python 3.4 the number of cases in which this comes up is far smaller now.
You will likely only run into this in in cases where you define a `__del__` operator via the C-API. (I'd be curious to hear of any other cases)

---

# Cycle example

```python
"""Example of a cyclic reference that can be resolved in both python3 and python2"""
import gc

class A:
    def __init__ (self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.other = None
    def set_other(self, other):
        self.other = other
    def __repr__(self):
        return "A({})".format(self.name)

a1 = A("first")
a2 = A("second")
a3 = A("third")
a1.set_other(a2)
a2.set_other(a3)
a3.set_other(a1)

a1 = a2 = a3 = None
n = gc.collect()
print("Number of unreachable objects {}".format(n)) # 6 items get freed
```

???

`gc.collect` calls a run of the cycle detector and returns the number of items that were freed from the run. In this case it was 6.

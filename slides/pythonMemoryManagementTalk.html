# Python to RAM

In this talk we will mostly cover the ??? part.

# First some background

We are going to assume we are on a Von Neumann Architecture

What this means is that RAM is essentially addressable.


---

# What is a variable?

* Symbolic name
* Storage location

???

If more than one symbolic name is located at the same storage location this is referred to as [aliasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing_(computing)).

# Pythontutor

There's a great site for getting intuition into how variables work in Python: http://pythontutor.com/

Let's have a look at this example:

```python
a = 1
b = "abc"
c = [a, b]
```

---

# Python Objects

Python is an "Object Oriented Language", meaning that almost everything is an object.

Python has the notion of a [data model](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html), where objects are the abstraction Python uses for data.

If you look around the source code you'll see these `PyObjects` all over the place. All these `PyObjects` are allocated in a chunk of memory that people may informally refer to as "the heap".

---

# Stack frames

We can set aside some memory for storing variables, we also have to set aside memory for handling function calls.

When we create a function we have to put aside the memory for all the variables inside it as well as the function call machinery .

This is most easily achieved with a stack based structure (but not the only way it can be done)

---

# Stack frames in Python

CPython has the notion of a Stack frame defines in [`PyFrameObject`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/veryhigh.html?highlight=pyframeobject#c.PyFrameObject) and evaluates them in using [`PyEval_EvalFrameEx`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/veryhigh.html?highlight=pyframeobject#c.PyEval_EvalFrameEx)


???

This `PyEval_EvalFrameEx` function is the evaluation function for Python, with PEP

# Garbage collection

Python is a managed language, you don't manually manage memory as you would in say C++ or Rust.

So when variables are not needed anymore Python has to reclaim the memory that the variables used to reside at.

How this works is implementation specific Jython uses the JVM memory management
CPython has a simple reference count based approach.

---

# Python's reference counter

Each time you make reference to a variable the reference count for the variable is incremented, when that count gets to zero then you have nothing referring to that variable anymore* at which point the item's `__del__` method gets called and the memory can be reused.

*There _are_ ways around this if you need them, see [weakref](https://docs.python.org/3/library/weakref.html) for example.

---

# What about cycles?

Unfortunately a purely reference counting based implementation can't break cycles.

This is why there's a second garbage collector in CPython that periodically runs:
